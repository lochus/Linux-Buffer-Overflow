# Linux-Buffer-Overflow
2S2C - 2 Secure 2 Crack

This is a relatively simple binary that has a couple of useful functions to jump to.

Try to decrypt the flag and pop a shell!

*Note: There's no need to manually decrypt the flag, the binary has everything in it that you need.*

**It's recommended to temporarily disable ASLR before attempting to exploit this binary:**

*echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space*

**Once you're finished, don't forget to re-enable it!**

*echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space*
